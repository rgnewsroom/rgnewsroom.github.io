Data journalism is not new, but it certainly has come into the spotlight recently. For years CAR (computer-assisted reporters) have been digging through databases for stories. And journalists have long included data into their stories. Often, these data are pre-packaged and given to journalists by PR folks.

While this data is valid, it's somewhat similar to taking a press release and re-writing it. And that's fine. Sometimes that's all a story is.

But sometimes a journalist wants to dig deeper or stumbles upon a data set that has a story or multiple stories embedded within. This is synonymous to setting out and more investigative work.

To be clear, there is a time and a place for both. One is quick and daily while the other is much more time intensive.

### All journalists are data journalists.

We all use data in stories. Some journalists simply have the data beat where they have some special expertise in how to interrogate data. Often contextual knowledge on education or county politics is more useful than specialize database expertise.

## Resources

There is a great online textbook, aptly named [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org). This is part of the introduction:

>Working with data is like stepping into vast, unknown territory. At first look, raw data is puzzling to the eyes and to the mind. Data as such is unwieldy. It is quite hard to shape it correctly for visualization. It needs experienced journalists, who have the stamina to look at often confusing, often boring raw data and “see” the hidden stories in there.

For more information on data journalism check out our [data repo](http://github.com/rgnewsroom/data/).

There's a general workflow and some tools that you can use to visualize data.
