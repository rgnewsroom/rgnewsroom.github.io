Twitter, love it or hate it, it's a part of journalism. Here are some tricks and tips for becoming an advanced Twitter user.

## Tools

There are a lot of tools out there that can make you a more efficient Twitter user. Tweetdeck (owned by Twitter) and HootSuite are the big ones. These essentially let you set up a Twitter environment with multiple feeds. You can also tweet from multiple accounts.

Learn more about these tools [here](https://github.com/rgnewsroom/twitter/tools/).

## Search

You can search do an advanced Twitter search [here](https://twitter.com/search-advanced).

But you can also do some custom searches in the search bar.

Try typing `near:Eugene,OR within:10mi "fire"` into the search bar. Boom, you just did a custom query on the Twitter API. Nice work.

You just searched for the term fire and filtered the results based on tweets that were geocoded within a 10 mile radius of the center point of Eugene, Ore. Easy, right? Just remember that not everyone has location turned on so you may want to try searching for just keywords occasionally.

**Note: At the top of the feed you can choose `Top` or `All`. `All` gives you the most recent and I would suggest using that.**

You can also search by individual users by typing `from:robertrdenton "fire"` just like the location search. There's a ton more that you can do with Twitter searches. Learn more about it  [here](https://support.twitter.com/articles/71577-using-advanced-search).

Pro tip: If you watch the URL that's where all the magic is done.

`https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=near%3Aeugene%2Cor%20within%3A10mi%20fire`

So instead of typing in that small box you can just edit it in the URL bar and hit return to do a new query.

**Note: These search tricks work in TweetDeck as well. I haven't tested it in HootSuite but I would imagine they would work there too.**

You can also search between certain dates:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>How to search for tweets from early days of twitter&#10;1. Replace npr with word&#10;2. Replace date range, if youâ€™d like &#10;&#10;<a href="https://t.co/ODbRw8moOi">https://t.co/ODbRw8moOi</a></p>&mdash; Melody Joy Kramer (@mkramer) <a href="https://twitter.com/mkramer/status/535513759000064000">November 20, 2014</a></blockquote>

## Embedding a tweet

We have a full writeup on embedding tweets [here](https://github.com/rgnewsroom/twitter/embeds/), but the TL;DR version is this:

* Go find the `More` or `...` option on any tweet
* Click embed
* Copy and paste that code where you want it to go

See? Easy.
