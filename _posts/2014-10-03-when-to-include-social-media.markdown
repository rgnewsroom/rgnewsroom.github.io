As a news provider it's our responsibility to make sure that the information we share is valid and it is quite easy to be duped on social media.

### Always verify content before publishing.

Some rules to live by:

* Always check out someone's profile before embedding their content. Do they say they live in Oregon or are they stealing someone else's content? Is their profile photo and bio appropriate? **Does it make sense that this person would be sharing this information?**
* Be wary of sensational images. In breaking news situations it is common for trolls to spread doctored images or images from other events as their own.
* The more shocking a post, the more likely it is to be false. Don't be suckered in by false statistics or sensational claims.
* Be cautious of awkward wordings. If a post could be misinterpreted it's best to steer clear.
* Avoid posts that have too much information. Gory images may have shock value but they may not be necessary. Ask yourself, **does this add to the story?**
* Watch out for duplicate posts. If two people say something similar, there's no need for both posts. This often happens with reporters in the field.
* **When in doubt, leave it out.**
