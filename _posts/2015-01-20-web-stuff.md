Ok, here's the deal. Learning something new is hard. It takes practice. This document is meant to give you a basic understanding of Web stuff. It's not going to make you a Web developer overnight and it's not going to give you super powers.

Moreover, this is an extremely rough overview of Web development so take it with a grain of salt. The old journalism adage, "If your mom says she loves you, check it out," applies here. Don't be afraid to ask questions and Google for answers.

## Boring stuff
Before we get into HTML and stuff like that you need to understand how the the Internet works.

The Internet isn't a place or thing, but a collection of computers. These include servers all over the world, including ones at the Guard and ones in massive climate controlled warehouses. And all a server is, is a slightly specialized computer. So there's really just a bunch of computers around the world, serving up pages to you and me.

#### What happens when you type in a URL

When you type in a website into your browser your computer sends a request to a Domain Name Server (DNS) to look up the IP address corresponding to the website you requested. Just like looking up someone's name in a phone book and finding what their phone number is.

Then, the DNS returns that address to your computer and your computer goes out and contacts that server. Much like you dialing that phone number.

That server then returns the requested page in the form of HTML, CSS and JavaScript documents that are assembled by your browser to display the requested page.

That was the *way* simplified version of how the Internet works but yay, ok now, moving on.

## Fun stuff
Go download a text editor like [SublimeText 3](http://www.sublimetext.com).

Open it up and save a new document as `index.html` to your Desktop. Type `Hello world!` and save. Now go to that file on your desktop and open it with a Web browser like Chrome or Firefox.

**Boom.**

It should say "Hello world!" and you just designed your first Web page. Congrats!

By default a server will return an index.html file if no file is requested. In other words, when you ask for `website.com` you're really asking for something like `website.com/index.html`.

You could also request `website.com/about.html` or `website.com/about/` but the latter would really return `website.com/about/index.html` which is different than the former. You can name pages anything you want and as long as someone types it in correctly, they'll see your page.

The document structure of your site is determined by the structure of files on the server. Think of it like folders on your computer.

And when you receive a 404 error that means that the page you requested doesn't exist. So you may request `website.com/contact.html` but that doesn't exist. What you really wanted was `website.com/contact/` which is really `website.com/contact/index.html` but your computer automatically looks for that `index.html` file.

## HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the language that your browser speaks. And for more interesting pages HTML requires more than just plain text. In order to tell your browser what kind of structure you want, you need to use tags.

Tags are wrappers for content. If you want to make a paragraph you wrap the paragraph text in `<p>` tags like so:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<p>Hello world!</p>
{% endhighlight %}

If you put this in your `index.html` file it should look really similar to what it was without the `<p>` tags.

Note that each `<p>` tag has a corresponding closing `</p>` tag. This is important. Whenever you open a tag you have to close it. Well, not always but for the most part you do. (There are some self-closing tags like <img> but let's leave that for another time.)

There are a lot of different tags, like header tags `<h1></h1>` and divider tags `<div></div>`. Div tags are really important. Let's try putting some of these tags together to add structure to the page. Type the following into your index file.

{% highlight html linenos %}
<html>
  <h1>Hedly herey</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolar sit amed blah blah blah.</p>
    <p>Blah.</p>
    <p>Kicker quote.</p>
  <div>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Save and open in a browser. It works, yes? Notice how the `<h1>` is bold and larger than the `<p>` text. And the paragraphs are space apart.

And you also might have noticed the `<html>` tag. Good, let's chat more about structure.

## Structure

The average HTML document has the following structure:

{% highlight html linenos %}
html
  - head
    - title
  - body
    - h1
    - div
      - p
      - p
      - p
{% endhighlight %}

That corresponds to something like this:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hedly herey</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolar sit amed blah blah blah.</p>
      <p>Blah.</p>
      <p>Kicker quote.</p>
    <div>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Try putting this into your `index.html` file. It has a clear structure, right? That's basic HTML styling that you get for free by using HTML. Clearly you would want to change the styles, but that's a conversation about CSS for another day.

Regardless of the styles, you could put this on a server and it would function properly.

You know what, we should do that.

## Hosting and domain names and such

Real quick I'll go over this because it's important but you won't really need it today.

To make a "real" web page you'll need to purchase a domain name like `yourname.com.` There is an annual rate with that so it doesn't become available again. Think of it as renting an the domain name. But the domain name is just a name. I can't host your code.

Note: Some places offer domain registration and hosting bundled for a decent price but they are two different services that you could get from two different companies.

Hosting is essentially a big box that you can put your stuff in and point at your domain name. Your site's requirements determine what kind of hosting you'll need. And, of course, hosting usually costs money unless you use Github (more on that below) or know someone with a server.

Ok, enough of that, let's make you a web page right now.

## Github

Head out to [github.com](http://github.com) and sign up for an account. Github is essentially a place to save your code, but they also allow you to **host** web pages for free with them. (For those of you wondering, Github will also give you free subdomains, something like `yourname.github.io`. You can purchase a domain and point Github toward that domain but you're getting ahead of the group.)

Once you have signed up for a Github account, download the Github app ([for mac](http://mac.github.com) or [for Windows](http://windows.github.com)). If you are a command line aficionado, you'd probably be more comfortable not using the app.

Ok, a few things.

1. Github uses git, but git and Github are not the same thing. When you Google for Github help, remember that.

1. The majority of Github tutorials use command line and NOT the app you just downloaded. Be aware that you never need to use the command line if you don't want to.

1. Github is awesome and you should version control every single one of your code projects in the future.

Ok, now we need to talk about Github Pages. And who better to talk Github Pages than Github Pages. So check out their tutorial [here](https://pages.github.com/) and feel free to use the `index.html` file you already made. Once you finish the tutorial, come on back and hopefully you'll have a web page!

...

Cool right? You have not only learned about HTML but you also have learned about Github AND you made a *real* website! Send the URL to your mom and post it on Facebook and stuff. Be proud.
