RG Newsroom is a collection of web tools that journalists anywhere can use to improve their storytelling. Not that your work needs any improvement, it's just that we can offer some... different... ways of doing things.

While these documents are tailored specifically for The Register-Guard reporters, the information here could easily be translated to any newsroom.
